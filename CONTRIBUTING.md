To ensure your contribution will be considered, please notify the owners of this repository on what areas you would like to work on.  Thank you!


## Code Contribution Guide

Here are the steps to contribute to this codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.  For the branch name, use github_id-issue#-one_to_three_word_desc.  Skip the issue # if there is no GitHub issue or better yet, file one.
2. Indicate what scenarios were tested.  Add screenshots if UI changed or to show how the behavior changed.  TBD: Add test cases.
3. Issue the pull request!


## Report bugs or enhancements
Report bugs or enhancements at [CodePadSite / codepad-issues](https://github.com/CodePadSite/codepad-issues)


## Write bug or enhancement issues
A bug issue should have:

- A quick summary of the problem
- Specify what OS, browser and version you are using
- For bugs, include steps to reproduce the problem or state if it's not reproducible.  Be as specific as possible.  Add screenshots if necessary.
- Write what you expect should have happened.
- Describe What actually happened.
- Add any analysis of the problem.

For each issue, specify the label whether it is a bug or enhancement.  Then specify the label for the priority (P1 to P5).  To reduce complexity, the concept of severity is combined with priority even though we are aware these are not the same.  We will primarily use priority to determine what to fix first.

The priority is as follows:

P1 - Product is unstable or this enhancement is badly needed.
P2 - A major feature is unstable or a major enhancement is needed.
P3 - A general issue or enhancement is found or needed.  This is typically where most of the issues will be at.
P4 - A minor issue or enhancement
P5 - A cosmetic issue or enhancement


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Follow the coding style of the file you are working on.  If it is a new file, the coding style is:

* Tabs take up four characters.
* Tabs remain as a tab character and not expanded to spaces.
* Remove trailing spaces.
* File format is UNIX-style linefeed as opposed to CR/LF.
* Have a space between keyword and `(` or `{`, e.g. `for (`
* Begin curly braces on the same line.
* Please add commments if the code is not intuitive or is complex.
